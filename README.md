This research project aims to delve into the foundational theories of web development in client environments, which are essential for the creation of modern and dynamic web applications. It will explore key concepts, from programming models to contemporary programming tools, with the following objectives:

-    Investigate and comprehend various client/server programming models and their applications in web development.
-    Analyze the mechanisms for executing code within a web browser and their significance in modern web development.
-    Evaluate the capabilities and limitations of in-browser execution, along with compatibility across different web browsers.
-    Compare scripting languages' characteristics with traditional programming, highlighting their pros and cons.
-    Explore the technologies and languages associated with client-side web development and their roles in application creation.
-    Examine how code integrates with HTML tags and its impact on the user experience.
-    Investigate and utilize diverse programming tools that facilitate client-side web development.

The project is divided into several parts:

-    Client/Server Programming Models: Research the most common client/server models and provide examples of applications that use each model.

-    Execution Mechanisms in Web Browsers: Study how JavaScript code runs in a browser, assess browser compatibility differences, and resolve compatibility issues in a web application.

-    Client-Side Programming Languages: Research languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, and others, and compare their features and applications.

-    Scripting Language Characteristics: Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of scripting languages compared to traditional programming.

-    Associated Technologies and Languages: Explore technologies like CSS and HTML5, and create a small web application by integrating JavaScript code in various ways.

-    Programming Tools: Use tools such as Visual Studio Code and Chrome DevTools for development.
